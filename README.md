- Hi, I'm riot33k, you can call me riot or Leo for short! I'm 14 years old with he/him pronouns.

- Currently in high school, trying to learn on how to code, but I really haven't had the time (and motivation) to learn. Always trying though.

- Working on a few projects:
   - riot33k.win
   - wryern.win
   - Bingle (helping, not working)

- Reach out to me.
   - Talk to me on [Discord.](https://discord.com/users/654805977287229440)
