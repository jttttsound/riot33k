# hey.

- Hi, I'm riot33k, you can call me riot or Leo for short. I'm <18.

- Currently in high school, trying to learn on how to code, but I really haven't had the time (and motivation) to learn. Always trying though.

- Working/helping on a few projects:
   - Haven't worked on but will work on: riot33k.win
   - Working on: wryern.win
   - Helping: Bingle

- Reach out to me.
   - Talk to me on [Discord.](https://discord.com/users/654805977287229440)
